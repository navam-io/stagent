# Getting Started

Get Stagent running in under a minute and create your first governed agent task.

## Installation

### Quick Start (npx)

Stagent runs as a single command with no clone or build step required:

```bash
npx stagent
```

This downloads and launches Stagent on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). All data is stored locally:

- **Database**: `~/.stagent/stagent.db` (SQLite with WAL mode)
- **Uploads**: `~/.stagent/uploads/`

### From Source

For contributors or developers who want full control:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/navam-io/stagent.git
cd stagent && npm install
npm run dev
```

### Requirements

- **Node.js 20+** required for the runtime
- **One or both AI provider credentials**:
  - Anthropic API key or OAuth token (for Claude Code runtime)
  - OpenAI API key (for Codex App Server runtime)

## First Run

When you open Stagent for the first time at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

1. **Home Workspace** appears with empty stat cards, an activity feed placeholder, and sidebar navigation
2. **Configure a runtime** by navigating to **Settings** to enter your provider credentials
3. **Test connectivity** using the **Test Connection** button in Settings to verify your runtime is reachable

The Home Workspace serves as your daily briefing with active work counts, pending reviews, and a live activity stream that populates as you create and execute tasks.

## Configuration

### Claude Authentication

Navigate to **Settings** to configure Claude access:

- **OAuth** (recommended) -- Uses your Claude Max or Pro subscription. No API key needed. Best for users with an existing Anthropic subscription
- **API Key** -- Enter your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for direct API access. Useful for programmatic or metered usage

OAuth is the default authentication method and is recommended for most users to avoid unexpected API charges.

### Codex Runtime Setup

To enable the OpenAI Codex runtime alongside Claude:

1. Navigate to **Settings**
2. Enter your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the OpenAI section
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify the Codex App Server is reachable
4. Once connected, you can select Codex as the runtime when creating or executing tasks

### Budget Configuration

Control AI spending from **Settings**:

- Set monthly or per-task budget limits
- View token usage breakdowns by provider
- Enable budget guardrails that pause execution when thresholds are reached
- Monitor cumulative spend on the **Cost & Usage** page (`/costs`)

### Tool Permissions

Agents request permission before using tools. Streamline approvals from **Settings**:

- **Always Allow** -- Save patterns for tools you trust (e.g., `Read`, `Bash(command:git *)`)
- **Presets** -- Enable read-only, git-safe, or full-auto permission bundles
- **Per-request** -- Review and approve individual tool calls from the **Inbox**

### Seed Sample Data

To explore Stagent with example data before creating your own:

1. Navigate to **Settings** then **Data Management**
2. Click **Seed Sample Data**
3. This creates sample projects, tasks, and workflows you can browse and execute

## Creating Your First Task

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) to see the kanban board
2. Click **Create Task** to open the task creation form
3. Enter a title and description for your task
4. (Optional) Click **AI Assist** to get an improved description, complexity estimate, and suggested agent profile
5. (Optional) Assign a project, select an agent profile, or attach documents
6. Click **Create** -- your task appears in the "Planned" column
7. Click the task card to open its detail view, then click **Execute** to dispatch it to an agent
8. Watch the **Monitor** page (`/monitor`) for live execution logs
9. Check **Inbox** (`/inbox`) for any tool approval requests the agent sends during execution

## CLI Usage

Stagent includes a CLI for headless and scripted workflows:

```bash
# Build the CLI from source
npm run build:cli

# Run the CLI
node dist/cli.js

# Or use the published package

```
