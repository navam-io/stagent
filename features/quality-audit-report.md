## 1. Test Health & Regression Guard

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Test files | 10 | 11 |
| Total tests | 100 | 119 |
| All passing | Yes | Yes |
| Statements | 90.27% | 98.38% |
| Branches | 77.57% | 86.91% |

|-------------|-----------|----------|------|
| `lib/agents/claude-agent.ts` | Yes | 97.53% | Low |
| `lib/settings/auth.ts` | Yes | **97.56%** | **Low** (was Medium) |
| `lib/utils/crypto.ts` | Yes | 100% | Low |

| `lib/constants/settings.ts` | Yes | 100% | Low |
| `lib/db/index.ts` | No | — | Medium (bootstrap DDL) |
| `app/api/settings/route.ts` | No | — | Medium (thin wrapper) |
| `app/api/projects/route.ts` | No | — | Medium (Drizzle query) |
| `components/` (15+ files) | No | — | Medium (UI-only) |

## 2. Coverage Status by Tier

### Critical Tier (target 90%+) — ALL PASS
| File | Stmts | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `lib/validators/project.ts` | 100% | PASS |
| `lib/validators/task.ts` | 100% | PASS |
| `lib/validators/settings.ts` | 100% | **PASS** (fixed this audit) |
| `lib/constants/task-status.ts` | 100% | PASS |
| `lib/constants/settings.ts` | 100% | PASS |

### High Tier (target 75%+) — ALL PASS
| File | Stmts | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `lib/agents/claude-agent.ts` | 97.53% | PASS |
| `lib/agents/execution-manager.ts` | 100% | PASS |
| `lib/agents/router.ts` | 100% | PASS |
| `lib/settings/auth.ts` | 97.56% | **PASS** (fixed this audit) |

### Medium Tier (target 60%+) — NOT APPLICABLE
No component or API route tests exist. This tier is deferred to post-MVP.

### Uncovered but Acceptable
| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `lib/db/index.ts` | Bootstrap DDL — integration test territory, low churn |
| `app/api/` routes | Thin wrappers over tested validators + DB layer |
| `components/ui/` | shadcn/ui — excluded by policy |

## 3. Acceptance Criteria Traceability

### Homepage Dashboard — 10/10 PASS
All criteria verified via code trace and browser evaluation:
- Time-of-day greeting renders correctly ("Good afternoon")
- Live DB counts in summary line ("1 failed task to address")
- 4 stat cards with correct navigation links
- Priority queue shows failed task
- Activity feed shows 6 agent log entries
- Quick actions grid (4 cards)
- Recent projects with progress bars
- Home in sidebar nav, Server Component pattern

### UX Gap Fixes — 3.5/4 (MINOR GAP)
- **Status filter**: Present on dashboard (project + status dropdowns)
- **Notification dismiss**: Individual dismiss buttons + "Dismiss read" bulk action
- **Monitor auto-refresh**: Working with Visibility API pause
  - **Minor**: Interval is 15s, spec says 30s (functional, just different timing)
- **Project detail**: Full implementation at `/projects/[id]` with status breakdown, task list, back link, 404 handling

### Workflow Engine — 6/6 PASS
All three patterns implemented (Sequence, Planner→Executor, Checkpoint). JSON storage in workflows table. Failed step retry supported.

### AI-Guided Task Definition — 5/7 (2 GAPS)
- **Missing toggle**: AI Assist panel is always visible below form, not toggled
- **Missing modify-before-accept**: Users can Accept or Dismiss suggestions but cannot edit them in-place before applying

### Rich Content Handling — 5/7 (2 GAPS)
- **File upload**: Working (stored in `~/.stagent/uploads/`)
- **Agent output rendering**: Working (`detectContentType()` + `<ContentPreview>`)
- **File download**: Working (`downloadAsFile()` Blob URL + `/api/uploads/[id]` with Content-Disposition)
- **File previews in task detail**: Not implemented (metadata not persisted to tasks table)
- **Markdown rendering**: Partial (headings and lists work, code fences render as `<hr>`, no inline formatting)
- **Syntax highlighting**: Not implemented (plain monospace `<pre>` blocks, no Prism/Shiki)

## 4. Browser Evaluation Results

All 7 key pages tested via Playwright MCP (headless Chromium):

| Page | URL | Status | Notes |
|------|-----|--------|-------|
| Homepage | `/` | PASS | Greeting, stats, activity feed, quick actions, recent projects |
| Projects | `/projects` | PASS | Project cards with task counts, New Project button |
| Project Detail | `/projects/[id]` | PASS | Status breakdown, task list, back link |
| Dashboard | `/dashboard` | PASS | Kanban board with 5 columns, filters, drag zones |
| Inbox | `/inbox` | PASS | Tabs (All/Unread/Permissions/Messages), dismiss buttons, mark unread |
| Monitor | `/monitor` | PASS | Auto-refresh toggle, manual refresh, metrics, log stream |
| Settings | `/settings` | PASS | Auth method radio (OAuth/API Key), connection status |
| Workflows | `/workflows` | PASS | Empty state with "New Workflow" button |

### Console Issues
- 1 error: `favicon.ico` 404 (cosmetic — no favicon configured)
- 2 warnings: Missing `aria-describedby` on project edit dialog comboboxes (accessibility)

---

## 5. Ship Readiness Verdict

### SHIP WITH KNOWN GAPS

**Strengths:**
- All 119 tests passing, 98.38% statement coverage
- All Critical and High tier coverage targets met
- All 7+ pages render correctly with no functional errors
- Core flows (projects, tasks, inbox, monitor, settings) fully operational
- Homepage dashboard is feature-complete

**Known Gaps (non-blocking for MVP):**
1. **AI-Guided Task Definition**: Missing toggle (2 of 7 criteria) — functional but less polished
2. **Rich Content Handling**: Missing file previews in task detail, partial markdown, no syntax highlighting (2 of 7 criteria) — upload, download, and agent output work; rendering needs polish
3. **Monitor auto-refresh**: 15s vs 30s interval (cosmetic difference)
4. **favicon.ico**: Returns 404 (cosmetic)
5. **Accessibility**: Missing aria-describedby on 2 comboboxes

**Recommended Post-MVP Actions:**
1. Add toggle for AI Assist panel + in-place suggestion editing
2. Implement file attachment metadata persistence for task detail previews
3. Add proper markdown renderer (e.g., react-markdown) with syntax highlighting
4. Add favicon
5. Fix aria-describedby warnings on project edit dialog
