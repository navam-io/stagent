- **Critical path**: database-schema → project-management → task-board → agent-integration → inbox-notifications / monitoring-dashboard
- **Foundation (parallel)**: cli-bootstrap, database-schema, app-shell can all be built simultaneously
- **Polish (parallel)**: P2 features are independent of each other, can be built in any order after agent-integration
- **Document Management**: file-attachment-data-layer unblocks all document features; preprocessing and agent-context can run in parallel
- **Completed**: `ai-assist-workflow-creation` bridges task assist into the workflow engine; all UI enhancement features are completed
- **Runtime Quality**: `sdk-runtime-hardening` tracks cross-cutting SDK audit fixes that span provider-runtime, usage-metering, and budget-guardrails features

## Open Questions

- **Pricing source of truth**: Need a durable model-pricing strategy for Claude and Codex so historical usage rows preserve derived cost even if provider pricing changes later
- **Parallel workflow UX ceiling**: Need to decide how much branch configurability to expose beyond the current fork/join pattern without turning the editor into a graph builder
- **Notification channel policy**: Need to define when Stagent should escalate from in-app approval toast to browser notification delivery, especially for hidden tabs
