# Stagent Release

This skill is only for the Stagent desktop release flow in this repository.

## Read First

- Read `scripts/release-desktop.mjs` before changing the release flow.
- Read `package.json` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` if the build or bundle output looks wrong.
- Read the `Desktop Release Checklist` section in `README.md` before changing release docs.

## Architecture Overview

Stagent Desktop is a **Tauri v2 shell wrapping a Node CLI sidecar** (not a static export).

**Boot flow:** Rust reserves a localhost port → spawns `dist/cli.js` via resolved Node binary → CLI runs DB migrations + `next start` → Rust polls localhost → `WebviewWindow::navigate()` hands off to the live app.

**Build flow:** `scripts/tauri.mjs` runs `build:cli` → `next build` → `cargo tauri build` → post-bundle fixups (`.next/node_modules` sync, artifact pruning) → `scripts/release-desktop.mjs` signs, packages DMG, and uploads.

**Key files:** `src-tauri/src/main.rs` (Rust shell), `bin/cli.ts` (Node CLI), `scripts/tauri.mjs` (build orchestrator), `scripts/release-desktop.mjs` (release packager).

**Logs:** `/tmp/stagent-boot.log` (boot phases), `/tmp/stagent-sidecar.log` (CLI stdout/stderr), `/tmp/stagent-crash.log` (Rust panics).

## Workflow

1. Work on macOS only. The release script depends on `ditto` and `hdiutil`.
2. Build and publish with `npm run desktop:release`.
3. For a local packaging check without touching GitHub, run `npm run desktop:release -- --skip-upload`.
4. The normalized release artifacts are written to `output/release/Stagent.dmg` and `output/release/Stagent.app.zip`.
5. Published releases require `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` and notarization credentials. Prefer `APPLE_NOTARY_PROFILE` backed by `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`; direct `APPLE_ID` + `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` + `APPLE_TEAM_ID` is also supported.
6. `--skip-upload` is the only supported path for ad-hoc local smoke builds without Apple credentials.
7. The published release must upload `Stagent.dmg` without a version in the filename so the stable download URL stays:
   `https://github.com/navam-io/stagent/releases/latest/download/Stagent.dmg`
8. Keep `public/desktop-icon-512.png` as the dedicated rounded desktop source icon with transparent corners. `public/icon-512.png` remains the square web/PWA icon.
9. Preserve DMG volume branding: the mounted image should include `.VolumeIcon.icns` and the volume must carry the Finder custom-icon flag.

## Release Rules

- Do not reintroduce a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the desktop release.
- Keep the uploaded DMG filename exactly `Stagent.dmg`.
- Prefer the default tag `desktop-v<package.json version>` unless the user explicitly asks for a different tag.
- Do not upload a release unless the app and DMG have been signed, notarized, and stapled.
- If the release process changes, update both this skill and the README release section in the same change.

## Known Issues & Fixes

Nine issues were solved across the desktop release pipeline. Reference these when diagnosing regressions.

### 1. DMG "damaged" error
**Symptom:** Gatekeeper rejects downloaded DMG as damaged.
**Cause:** Tauri only signs the Rust binary, not the full `.app` bundle. Quarantine triggers strict checks.
**Fix:** `codesign --force --deep --sign -` before DMG packaging (`signAppBundle()` in `release-desktop.mjs`).

### 2. Finder launch crash (SIGABRT)
**Symptom:** App crashes from Finder but works from terminal.
**Cause:** GUI apps get minimal PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`) — Node not found.
**Fix:** `resolve_node_bin()` in `main.rs` probes `/usr/local/bin/node`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/node`, nvm/fnm/volta paths.

### 3. `_up_/` resource paths
**Symptom:** `resolve_app_root()` can't find `dist/cli.js` in bundle.
**Cause:** Tauri rewrites `../` to `_up_/` inside `Contents/Resources/`.
**Fix:** `resolve_app_root()` checks `resource_dir/_up_/` first, then `resource_dir/`.

### 4. `#!/usr/bin/env node` fails from Finder
**Symptom:** `env: node: No such file or directory` when CLI spawns `next`.
**Cause:** Same minimal PATH issue as #2, but one layer deeper in shell shims.
**Fix:** Rust prepends node's directory to `PATH` before spawning the CLI child process.

### 5. `.bin/next` symlink broken
**Symptom:** `Cannot find module '../server/require-hook'` from `.bin/next`.
**Cause:** Tauri flattens symlinks to file copies — relative requires inside `.bin/` resolve to wrong paths.
**Fix:** CLI resolves `node_modules/next/dist/bin/next` directly, spawns via `process.execPath`.

### 6. `.next/node_modules` missing from bundle
**Symptom:** `Failed to load external module better-sqlite3-<hash>` at startup.
**Cause:** `next build` generates alias symlinks under `.next/node_modules/`; Tauri doesn't preserve them.
**Fix:** `scripts/tauri.mjs` copies `.next/node_modules` into the finished app with `verbatimSymlinks: true`.

### 7. Port drift
**Symptom:** Boot screen stuck waiting, but sidecar is healthy on a different port.
**Cause:** CLI re-scanned for available ports instead of using the port Rust assigned.
**Fix:** `bin/cli.ts` treats explicit `--port` as authoritative — no re-scan.

### 8. Bundle bloat
**Symptom:** DMG jumps to >500MB after production build lands.
**Cause:** `.next/dev` (~751MB) and other build artifacts bundled verbatim.
**Fix:** `scripts/tauri.mjs` prunes `.next/{dev,cache,diagnostics,trace*,turbopack,types}` post-bundle.

### 9. Boot screen hang after sidecar ready
**Symptom:** Boot screen stays visible even though sidecar is healthy.
**Cause:** JS-only `window.location.replace()` handoff races or misses on mounted-DMG launches.
**Fix:** Rust owns `WebviewWindow::navigate()` after `wait_for_server()` succeeds. JS is presentation-only.

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Boot screen stuck | `/tmp/stagent-boot.log` — find last phase. Missing `sidecar_ready`? Check sidecar log |
| Sidecar crash | `/tmp/stagent-sidecar.log` and `/tmp/stagent-crash.log` |
| Module not found | Verify `.next/node_modules` sync ran in `scripts/tauri.mjs` |
| Port conflict | Check for IPv6 listeners: `lsof -i :3210` — both IPv4 and IPv6 |
| DMG damaged | Verify `signAppBundle()` ran before DMG packaging |
| Bundle >500MB | Verify prune step ran — check for `.next/dev` in app bundle |
| `env: node` error | Check `resolve_node_bin()` covers the target machine's node path |
| Handoff not navigating | Confirm `main.rs` calls `WebviewWindow::navigate()` — JS must NOT own navigation |

## Verification

- Confirm the release script finishes with a successful `hdiutil verify`.
- For a published release, confirm the script reports `Notarized: yes`.
- If you published the release, verify the asset names on GitHub with `gh release view <tag> --json assets,url`.
- If the user asks about the website download link, point it to the stable asset URL, not the generic releases page.
- **Local smoke:** `npm run desktop:release -- --skip-upload` runs the full flow without GitHub upload.
- **Sidecar smoke:** integrated into `npm run desktop:build` — launches `dist/cli.js` under Finder-style minimal PATH and checks HTTP 200.
- **DMG smoke:** integrated into `npm run desktop:release` — mounts DMG, launches app, checks boot log phases through `handoff_navigated`.
- **Manual DMG test:** mount the DMG, drag to `/Applications`, launch from Finder, confirm workspace loads within 15s.
