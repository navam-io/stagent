# Stagent Release

This skill is only for the Stagent desktop release flow in this repository.

## Read First

- Read `scripts/release-desktop.mjs` before changing the release flow.
- Read `package.json` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` if the build or bundle output looks wrong.
- Read the `Desktop Release Checklist` section in `README.md` before changing release docs.

## Workflow

1. Work on macOS only. The release script depends on `ditto` and `hdiutil`.
2. Build and publish with `npm run desktop:release`.
3. For a local packaging check without touching GitHub, run `npm run desktop:release -- --skip-upload`.
4. The normalized release artifacts are written to `output/release/Stagent.dmg` and `output/release/Stagent.app.zip`.
5. The published release must upload `Stagent.dmg` without a version in the filename so the stable download URL stays:
   `https://github.com/navam-io/stagent/releases/latest/download/Stagent.dmg`
6. Keep `public/icon-512.png` square and unmasked. Do not bake rounded corners into the source icon; macOS applies that mask later.
7. Preserve DMG volume branding: the mounted image should include `.VolumeIcon.icns` and the volume must carry the Finder custom-icon flag.

## Release Rules

- Do not reintroduce a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the desktop release.
- Keep the uploaded DMG filename exactly `Stagent.dmg`.
- Prefer the default tag `desktop-v<package.json version>` unless the user explicitly asks for a different tag.
- If the release process changes, update both this skill and the README release section in the same change.

## Verification

- Confirm the release script finishes with a successful `hdiutil verify`.
- If you published the release, verify the asset names on GitHub with `gh release view <tag> --json assets,url`.
- If the user asks about the website download link, point it to the stable asset URL, not the generic releases page.
